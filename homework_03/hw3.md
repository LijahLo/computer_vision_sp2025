3. Training function [Total Points: 15]
4. Function to save model weights [Total Points: 5]
5. Codes to test the two models [Total Points: 5]
6. Answers to questions in the end. [Total Points: 25]

**Note** For every step, add your comments as directed. Failure to do so would result in some penalty. 

## Deliverables and Submission Guidelines:

There are 2 deliverables for this assignment.

* The jupyter notebook `hw3.ipynb` with your saved output.

* Write-up for questions in the end as a pdf or word file. Also attach screenshots of your model training in the document.
**Naming convention: John_Doe_Assignment2.pdf or John_Doe_Assignment2.docx**

* Email your submissions (as a zipped file) to me. If you use github repos for submission, make sure it is not public and add me as a collaborator.

* Always reference/cite your online resources for codes and write-ups. Failure to do so would result in penalty.
